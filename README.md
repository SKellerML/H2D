# H2D


This is a rather old personal project of mine. Using OpenGL, DevIL (Image loading library), FTGL, Irrklang, GLFW3 and GLEW32 I've created a small engine for a top down game. Due to time constraints the game could not be completed back then and it was abandoned more than 6-10 years ago, but it has the following features:

- Grid based word
- Destructible walls
- A* pathfinding
- You only see what the player would see (Accomplished using masks)
- Working Menu Buttons
- Weapons/Gadgets
